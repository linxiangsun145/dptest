        "## Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "One might argue that VGG is the first truly modern convolutional neural network. While AlexNet introduced many of the components of what make deep learning effective at scale, it is VGG that arguably introduced key properties such as blocks of multiple convolutions and a preference for deep and narrow networks. It is also the first network that is actually an entire family of similarly parametrized models, giving the practitioner ample trade-off between complexity and speed. This is also the place where modern deep learning frameworks shine. It is no longer necessary to generate XML configuration files to specify a network but rather, to assemble said networks through simple Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        "More recently ParNet :cite:`Goyal.Bochkovskiy.Deng.ea.2021` demonstrated that it is possible to achieve competitive performance using a much more shallow architecture through a large number of parallel computations. This is an exciting development and there is hope that it will influence architecture designs in the future. For the remainder of the chapter, though, we will follow the path of scientific progress over the past decade.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Exercises\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Compared with AlexNet, VGG is much slower in terms of computation, and it also needs more GPU memory.\n",
        "    1. Compare the number of parameters needed for AlexNet and VGG.\n",
        "    1. Compare the number of floating point operations used in the convolutional layers and in the fully connected layers.\n",
        "    1. How could you reduce the computational cost created by the fully connected layers?\n",
        "1. When displaying the dimensions associated with the various layers of the network, we only see the information associated with eight blocks (plus some auxiliary transforms), even though the network has 11 layers. Where did the remaining three layers go?\n",
        "1. Use Table 1 in the VGG paper :cite:`Simonyan.Zisserman.2014` to construct other common models, such as VGG-16 or VGG-19.\n",
        "1. Upsampling the resolution in Fashion-MNIST eight-fold from $28 \\times 28$ to $224 \\times 224$ dimensions is very wasteful. Try modifying the network architecture and resolution conversion, e.g., to 56 or to 84 dimensions for its input instead. Can you do so without reducing the accuracy of the network? Consult the VGG paper :cite:`Simonyan.Zisserman.2014` for ideas on adding more nonlinearities prior to downsampling.\n"
