        "a batch norm, only that it is applied to one observation at a time. Consequently both the offset and the scaling factor are scalars. For an $n$-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{x}$, layer norms are given by\n",

That is, we have $\\textrm{LN}(\\mathbf{x}) \\approx \\textrm{LN}(\\alpha \\mathbf{x})$ for any choice of $\\alpha \\neq 0$. This becomes an equality for $|\\alpha| \\to \\infty$ (the approximate equality is due to the offset $\\epsilon$ for the variance).\n",

        "\n",
        "The original paper proposing batch normalization :cite:`Ioffe.Szegedy.2015`, in addition to introducing a powerful and useful tool,\n",

        "rendering the name a misnomer. If anything, it is closer to concept drift.\n",
        "ii) The explanation offers an under-specified intuition\n",
        "but leaves the question of *why precisely this technique works*\n",
        "an open question wanting for a rigorous explanation.\n",
        "Throughout this book, we aim to convey the intuitions that practitioners\n",
        "use to guide their development of deep neural networks.\n",
        "However, we believe that it is important\n",

        "Following the success of batch normalization,\n",
        "its explanation in terms of *internal covariate shift*\n",
        "has repeatedly surfaced in debates in the technical literature\n",

        "In a memorable speech given while accepting a Test of Time Award\n",
        "at the 2017 NeurIPS conference,\n",
        "Ali Rahimi used *internal covariate shift*\n",
        "as a focal point in an argument likening\n",
        "the modern practice of deep learning to alchemy.\n",
        "Subsequently, the example was revisited in detail\n",

        "Other authors\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "We note that the *internal covariate shift*\n",

        "Batch normalization has proven an indispensable method,\n",
        "applied in nearly all deployed image classifiers,\n",
        "earning the paper that introduced the technique\n",
        "tens of thousands of citations. We conjecture, though, that the guiding principles\n",
        "of regularization through noise injection, acceleration through rescaling and lastly preprocessing\n",
        "may well lead to further inventions of layers and techniques in the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "On a more practical note, there are a number of aspects worth remembering about batch normalization:\n",
        "\n",
        "* During model training, batch normalization continuously adjusts the intermediate output of\n",
        "  the network by utilizing the mean and standard deviation of the minibatch, so that the\n",
        "  values of the intermediate output in each layer throughout the neural network are more stable.\n",
        "* Batch normalization is slightly different for fully connected layers than for convolutional layers. In fact,\n",
        "  for convolutional layers, layer normalization can sometimes be used as an alternative.\n",
        "* Like a dropout layer, batch normalization layers have different behaviors\n",
        "  in training mode than in prediction mode.\n",
        "* Batch normalization is useful for regularization and improving convergence in optimization. By contrast,\n",
        "  the original motivation of reducing internal covariate shift seems not to be a valid explanation.\n",
        "* For more robust models that are less sensitive to input perturbations, consider removing batch normalization :cite:`wang2022removing`.\n",
        "\n",
